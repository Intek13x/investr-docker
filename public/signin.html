<h4>Sign-In Is Required To Access All The Companies</h4>
<hr class="thin">
There is going to be a steep increase in my hosting cost from 1st May 2017. One way to limit cost is by conserving the bandwidth.<br>
<br>
Hence from 1st May 2017 (Monday) users will have to sign in to access all companies tracked on InvestR. Users who have not signed-in will be able to access a sample of 25 companies.<br>
<br>
NOTE: There is no separate "Registration" process. First time users also just need to use the "Sign-In" process.<br>
