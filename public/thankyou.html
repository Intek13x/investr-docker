Dear InvestR User,<br>
<br>
When We created Investr few years back, We was aware that this day will come but We was not sure when!<br>
<br>
Alas, that day is: <b>15th July 2019<b><br>
<br>
Things have changed at my end and We will not be able to support and run InvestR beyond 15th July 2019. We would like to thank all of my 1400 users for their love and support and in many instances -- money!<br>
<br>
Happy investing and if you want to keep in touch then you can always find me at <a href="mailto:yourmailid@yourmailprovider.com?Subject=Hi!">yourmailid@yourmailprovider.com</a><br>
<br>
Regards!<br>
Chirag<br>
