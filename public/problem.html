        <h4>InvestR now uses SSL</h4>
        Starting 6th May 2018, InvestR has moved from using http to https. If you were able access InvestR without any issues before but are facing issues on or after 6th May 2018, then We suggest you clear InvestR related files from your browser cache and then try accessing https://investr.co.in/. You can also try opening the browser in Private/Incognito mode and then accessing https://investr.co.in/.

        <h4>Known issue while Signing-In using Google's Chrome browser</h4>
        This is a known issue and affects many website including InvestR. If you face this issue then follow the following steps:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure you are accessing https://investr.co.in (i.e. do not use www in the URL)
          <li>In your Google Chrome browser, goto Chrome -> Preferences -> Show Advanced Settings -> Content Settings.</li>
          <li>Uncheck the "Block third-party cookies and site data" option.</li>
          <li>Sign-In using your GMail login and password into InvestR</li>
          <li>Once signed in, you can check the "Block third-party cookies and site data" option again.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Block third-party cookies option needs to be unchecked only while signing in. It can immediately be checked again after you have signed in. Once signed in, you will stay signed in till you explicitly sign out.</b><br>
        <br>
        We am not setting any 3rd part cookie but, We think GMail and/or Google Analytics is considered a 3rd party in this case with InvestR being the first party and you the user being the second party.<br>
        <br>
