    </section>
    <section class="card">
        Investr gives a company <b>personalized weighted</b> SCORE based on company's last 3 years' and last 5 quarters' fundamental performance. It also highlights, with green and blue bands, companies that are trading at attractive valuations. Investr also reports whether or not a company's top-line and bottom-line growth is consistent and if a company is trading above or below its 30 day moving average. All this information is supported via beautiful and intuitive charts.<br>
        <br>
        InvestR was created to answer the following 3 questions:<br>
        <ol>
              <li>Is a particular company, fundamentally better than another?</li>
              <li>How are the current valuations of that company?</li>
              <li>Can we trust the company's growth consistency and buy the company at current market price?</li>
        </ol>
        Investr helps you "narrow your focus" so that you can focus on few good companies for a further detailed investigation.

        <h2>Why should you use it?</h2>
        We all differ from each other when it comes to deciding which fundamental parameter is more important than others. Some people prefer stocks with high growth and high PE while others prefer stocks with low PE and high dividend yield. Investr lets <b>you</b> assign weightages to the parameters of your choice so that you can discover "your type" of companies.<br>
        <br>
        Investr comes with 3 pre-defined settings: "Growth", "Value" and "Fixed Income". Users who want full control can use "Advanced Options".<br>
        <br>
        Not just valuation setting, every aspect of InvestR is customizable. Users can set the range parameters for the green and blue bands, tolerance limits for the various searches and more by changes the values in the Settings page (<i class="fa fa-cogs" aria-hidden="true"></i>).<br>
        <br>
        Investr tracks more than 600 companies that account for 97% of total Indian market capitalization. Apart from getting names of the companies with highest (and lowest) scores, you can search Investr to find the ratings and valuations of your favorite company. You can sort companies by their PE (Price to Earning ratio), PEG (PE to Growth ratio) and Div Yield (Dividend Yield). Searching for companies on Investr is ridiculously fast. You can search for companies by their name, NSE ticker, sector or sub-sector. You can create a "Watchlist" of your favorite companies and search for them. You can also filter <i>in</i> the highlighted companies by searching for "/green", "/blue" or "/all" (without quotes but / included).<br>
        <br>
        The tab labeled "Optimized" with a <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> next to it, scores companies using optimized weights. If you want to have a look at fundamentally strong companies without setting your personal weight preferences, then we suggest that you use the optimized weights. We use optimized weights tab 90% of the time.<br>
        <br>
        We have added lots of tooltips across InvestR to provide quick help. These help tooltips can be disabled in the settings page (<i class="fa fa-cogs" aria-hidden="true"></i>).

        <h2>How is the score calculated?</h2>
        The scores are calculated in 3 steps. In the first step YoY, QoQ and TTM growth in fundamental parameters like total income, net profit, earnings per share, profit margin and dividend yield is plotted on a bell curve and given points.<br>
        <br>
        In the second step, points given in the first step are weighed based on the weights given by the user for each fundamental parameter. And in the third and final step, a percentage score is calculated based on the total weighted points and maximum weighted points that are possible.<br>
        <br>
        Optimized scores use predefined weights.

        <h2>How frequently is the data updated?</h2>
        Data on Investr is updated multiple times a day. The name of the latest quarter that is included in the calculations is mentioned besides the company's name. (Note: Stock prices on Investr are NOT live.)<br>
        <br>
        We understand that accurate data is extremely important for making decisions in equity investing. We take great care in making sure that the data on Investr is accurate. At the same time, it is difficult for a single individual to verify all the details of more than 600 companies. Please bring any data anomalies that you find to my notice.<br>
        <br>
        Note: If a company has reduced its face value and split its shares in the middle of the financial year, then it might lead to inconsistent dividend yield calculation.
