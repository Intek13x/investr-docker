                <li>New Feature: Based on the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/wLnGFnJxgNu8uYjb2">survey feedback</a> We observed many people were either not using the search tags or not using them to their full potential. So We have exposed the most powerful tag in a separate tab named: Gems! Stocks listed in the Gems tab have good fundamentals, resonable valuations and are off their recent highs. If you consider buying these stocks then you should buy them <b>slowly over a period of time</b>, till they are listed in the Gems tab. Disclaimer: We am investing in the "Gems" at my own risk and you should invest in "Gems" at your own risk too!</li>

                <li>New Feature: We have added two new buttons to the Watchlist page.

                    <li> Compare Any 2: This feature will compare any 2 selected companies head-to-head. We created this feature to see the information about 2 companies side by side but then augmented it by giving them points and displaying the better company!</li>
                </ul>
                Both these features require that the user is logged-in and has companies in their watchlist.
                </li>
                <li>We am currenting running a <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/wLnGFnJxgNu8uYjb2">5 question survey</a> to know how people use InvestR so that We can make it better. We would request you to take a minute of your time and please give me feedback.</li>

        <h2>21-February-2017</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>New Feature: During the result season, it is possible that even after all our due diligence, few of our companies don't come out with better results. Either the growth falls or the margins dip. During other times it is possible that the stock of our well performing company becomes overvalued and we would like to book profits in it. In such situations sometimes we might be interested in better opportunities. We have tried to ease this search with "Replace Company" feature to InvestR. Upon hovering over the <i class="fa fa-random" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon one can see companies that are better than the selected company wrt the following parameters:
                <ul>
                    <li>Quarterly YoY growth of TL, BL and EPS</li>
                    <li>Yearly TTM growth of TL, BL and EPS</li>
                    <li>Better profit margins</li>
                    <li>Higher dividend yield</li>
                    <li>Lower PE</li>
                </ul>
                These values also have a 20% tolerance range.<br>
                It goes without saying that, one needs to analyze the companies returned as "better" for consistency, valuation amongst peers and any other current news flow about the sector and the company before making any final decision.<br>
                Feedback is welcome, as always. And thank you for supporting InvestR!</li>

        <h2>17-October-2016</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>High-Low PE Range: As you are aware companies trade in their own PE band based on how the market values the sector of the company and the company itself. If we observe a company over multiple years we can see that there is an average-approximate lower and higher band for every company and the company's PE stays within this band for most of the time. When the PE of the company falls below the lower end, it comes up again rather quickly and when the PE of the company rises above the higher end, it comes down again rather quickly. Hence it makes sense to track these higher and lower bands to see how the company is currently valued. It is also nice to know the High-PE/Low-PE ratio. Companies with a ratio close to 1 can be considered more consistent valuation-wise. We created a histogram and found 1.5 to be a good boundary for consistency. Which means that companies for which the ratio is between 1 and 1.5 can be considered consistent. All this information is available in the "Analysis" tool tip and on the charts page. Of course, when a stock gets re-rated based on its performance the High/Low PEs ranges will not be valid and time needs to be given to see of the stocks settles down in the new range and creates new High/Low PE rages.</li>

        <h2>30-September-2016</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Detailed charts page of the company now shows historical score timeline. Note: As the score is a combination of fundamentals and valuations, in the short term, a fall in stock price might increase the score a bit (couple of points) as the valuations become cheaper and vice-versa. But big changes to score will occur after the quarterly results as a change to the fundamentals of a company has a stronger effect on score and over a period of an year or so, price should move in sync with the score.</li>
                <li>Because of the geo-political tension in the sub-continent, yesterday (29th) was crazy day for my portfolio. We took that fall as an opprotunity and bought: Edelweiss, Menon Bearings and Sanofi.</li>
