    <h2>Replies to Feedback Queries</h2>

    Hi!<br>
    <br>
    Few days back We had started a small <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/wLnGFnJxgNu8uYjb2">5 question survey (you can still respond)</a> to know how people use InvestR so that We can tweak it to make it better.<br>
    <br>
    The most important thing We learnt from the responses is 75% people have made an investment decision based on InvestR!<br>
    <br>
    People who used the various search tags and who did not are split 50-50. As a result of this feedback We have exposed the most important search tag "/gems" as part of the "Gems!" tab.<br>
    <br>
    We also found that most people (70%) just use the default weights and tolerances. As a result We have tweaked the default settings to reflect the settings that We use for myself. Note: This will not affect you if you have personalized the settings either locally or after logging in.<br>
    <br>
    Other thing We learnt is most people (60%) people visit InvestR when they want to look up a company, followed by weekly visitor (25%) and then daily (15%).<br>
    <br>
    We also received some comments and queries as part of that feedback. Here are my responses to those questions and queries:<br>


    <h3>Thank you! InvestR has helped me make money!</h3>
    You are welcome! :-) Nothing makes me happier than InvestR users making money!<br>

    <h3>Great, lightweight tool. Love the comparison feature.</h3>
    Thank you! Comparision feature is the latest addition. We am glad that you like it!<br>

    <h3>You are doing a great job! This is an excellent site similar to screener. We stopped using other business sites. Finding your posts in Reddit very useful. Currently We am out of country, but once We am in India we should catch up!</h3>
    Thank you! We should definitely catch up!<br>

    <h3>Will a opposite of 30DMA be available? That is, list of companies that are being sold above 30DMA?</h3>
    During a bull run most/many companies will trade above their 30 DMA. Hence, just the price being more
    than 30 DMA is not a reason to sell. Other fundamental and valuation parameters should be seen. BUT,
    We am looking into extending the scope of the "caution" icon/tag to include companies that are very
    overvalued and should not be bought inspite of having good fundamentals.<br>

    <h3>We got to know about InvestR from Reddit. You are doing a good damn job and We wish We could at least gift you a small amazon gift card but I'm broke af college student. Thanks for your work.</h3>
    Hey! Thank you! And don't fret about the Amazon gift card. Fact that you thought about it made me feel good! :-) We hope you do great in both investing and academics!<br>

    <h3>We would like an option to create different watchlists, because We watch different companions in a particular sector so We would like to create multipe watchlist for different sectors.</h3>
    We will put multiple watchlist feature in my bucket list. Till then you can try the falling: Add all the companies to the current (single) watchlist. Then use multiple search tag to filter companies as per your wish. For example: "/watchlist /auto" or "/watchlist /pharma" (without quotes).<br>

    <h3>Why is it that some of the listed stocks are not available on your site one example is "bharat seats"?</h3>
    When We created InvestR last year it started with top 500 companies (by market cap) that constituted 96% of the total market cap of the market. And kept adding companies as and when required or suggested by users. After Q3 results, few weeks back, We deleted close to 50 companies as they were all loss making (qtr after qtr and year after year) with negative scores. As for Bharat Seats, We have added it to InvestR.<br>

    <h3>Is it possible to combine two/three different search tags? We want to search the /sync companies in /auto sector with /pelow valuation. Is something like this possible?</h3>
    Of course!!! That is what makes InvestR what it is! Compound search tags. You can find all pharma companies that are consistent and whose price is less than 30 DMA by typing: /pharma /consistent /price<br>

    <h3>You are doing good work and i wish you all the success.</h3>
    Thank you! :-)<br>

    <h3>We am still not able to decode InvestR!</h3>
    Oh! We am sorry to hear that. We created InvestR for my own investing needs. But We have written extensive <a href="https://investr.co.in/help.html">Help</a> and <a href="https://investr.co.in/about.html">About</a> files for InvestR to help other climbing the learning curve. We suggest you read the About and Help page and if you still have any question then do mail me and We will do my best to help you out.<br>

    <h3>It's interesting. Keep it up!</h3>
    Thank you!<br>

    <h3>Keep up the good work. We came to know about this app from r/IndiaInvestments (Reddit).</h3>
    Thank you!<br>

    <h3>This is my first visit to the site.</h3>
    Hope you found what you were looking for, else feel free to send me an email!<br>
