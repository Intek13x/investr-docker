        If you have not signed into InvestR using your Google ID then we do not explicitly collect ANY information. The web server on which InvestR runs does log the IP address of the machine from which InvestR was accessed. We neither have time nor interest to check these logs. These log files can be used in case of any any errors or denial of service attack on the site.<br>
        <br>
        For the users who have not signed in, we use the "localStorage" of the browser to store user settings. This data is private to that specific browser. For such users we have no way of knowing what data has been stored in the localStorage of their browser. This data remains local to that browser on that machine. We do not use cookies.<br>
        <br>
        We integrate Google Analytics in InvestR to know about how many people are using InvestR. Google Analytics gives me general information like number of users, page view count, session count, browser type, OS type, city etc. There is nothing that can identify a particular individual. We use the information from Google Analytics to see which pages are accessed more so that we can fine tune them. Usage data from Google Analytics also makes me feel happy about how many people are using InvestR.<br>
        <br>
        If you signed into InvestR using your Google ID then we collect your name, your email ID and the URL to your Google profile picture when you sign in. we use your email id to uniquely identify your settings in the database. We am not using the name and profile picture as of now. But we plan to use the name to address you in case you opt-in for any email communication. We might diplay the logged in user's profile picture in the place where we curently show the email id.<br>
        <br>
        While you are signed-in, any settings data or watchlist information that you save is saved on the server's database and localStorage. We also log the total numbers of sessions for the logged-in users but we do not log or track any other activity during those sessions. i.e. while we know that a particular user has used InvestR 30 times, we do not know what they did during those 30 sessions.<br>
        <br>
        NOTE: WE DO NOT HAVE ANY TYPE OF ACCESS TO YOUR GOOGLE PASSWORD. WE CANNOT AND DO NOT STORE IT OR CHECK IT. AUTHENTICATION IS DONE DIRECTLY BY GOOGLE USING OPEN AUTHENTICATION API.<br>
        <br>
        Users can delete their account information using the Delete InvestR Account pages that is linked from the Settings page.<br>
        <br>
        As you must have observed there is no advertisement on InvestR. We do not and will not share any information collected by InvestR on my server with anyone. We will try my very best to protect this information from hackers and other internet evils.<br>
        <br>
        InvestR points to two 3rd party websites (https://finance.google.com and https://www.amazon.in) as of now. Upon clicking those links the privacy policy of InvestR does not apply.<br>
        <br>
        By using this site, you are giving your concent to this privacy policy. This policy can and will be updated as required.<br>
        <br>
