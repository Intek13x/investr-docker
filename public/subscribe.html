<h2>Buy? Sell? Hold? Support Investr!</h2>

Starting <b>1st April 2018</b>, InvestR will become a paid service. There are costs associated with hosting and maintaining InvestR and We think it is fair that users who have benefited from InvestR pay a small amount to maintain InvestR and make it better. By paying this small fee, you will get access to all the features of the tool that We have put my heart and mind in; plus you will also get the warm and fuzzy feeling that one gets after supporting a good cause! These funds will also aid in my goal of increasing the total number of companies tracked to 1500.<p>

<ul><b>Subscription Fee: 1200 Rs / Year</b>
<i class='inLineHelp'><a href="#steps">(Steps for paying the subscription fee and activating the service)</a></i></ul>

<h3>New Users:</h3>

New users can access all the features InvestR for free for the first 6 months. During this time the users can decide if they think if InvestR is worth paying for.

<h3>Existing Users:</h3>

If InvestR has helped you in making a buy/sell/hold decision in the past then you can continue accessing the service by paying the access fee any time before 1 April 2018 and you will still get access validity till 30th April 2019. If you wish to know more about your past InvestR usage, then just go to the settings page where you will find your usage as compared to the average usage.

<h3>Refund:</h3>

Users can use all the features of InvestR for free for the first 6 months. During this time they can decide if they want to pay for the service. Oweing to the nature of the service, once paid, the subscription is non-refundable. But, We will refund your subscription fee based on pro rata basis rounded to the month via UPI, NEFT/IMPS or cheque (based on your choice) if We am not in a position to maintain InvestR due to unforseen circumstances.

<h3><a name=steps>Steps for paying the subscription fee and activating the service:</a></h3>

<ul>
    <li>Easiest way to support InvestR is via UPI.</li>
</ul>

<b><ul>IMPORTANT: Make sure you enter your email id in the comments of your transaction. You can also send an email to yourmailid@yourmailprovider.com with the transaction details.</ul></b><br>

After making the payment you can immediately access the site by pressing the "We have Paid" button on the Settings page. We will verify the payment and activate your subscription.<p>

<h3>Status Codes:</h3>

<b>LIFE:</b> Life membership is given to me, my family, friends and early supporters<p>

<b>DONOR:</b> Donor level membership is given to the yearly donors. Expires every year on 31st March.<p>

<b>FREE:</b> When an account is created, membership status is set to FREE. FREE accounts can access all features for free for the first 6 months after which the account status will change to EXPIRED<p>

<b>PAID:</b> PAID status means that subscription payment has been made but the payment verification is pending. After paying the subscription fee, users can access all the features immediately after pressing the "We Have Paid" button on the settings page. This is when the status changes to PAID.<p>

<b>UNPAID:</b> Status changes from PAID to UNPAID if payment could not be verified. This account status means, the user pressed the "We have Paid" button without making a payment. We will contact the user via email before changing the status to UNPAID. We am hoping this status will not be used often. UNPAID accounts cannot self active the subscription. It has to be done only via email request.<p>

<b>ACTIVE:</b> Status changes from PAID to ACTIVE when payment has been verified.<p>

<b>EXPIRED:</b> Status changes from FREE or ACTIVE to EXPIRED after the free or paid subscription is over.<p>


<h3>Issues:</h3>

While We have taken a lot of care to roll out the subscription realated features, please excuse me in case of any hiccups. We will work with you to resolve any issue that you face. Most importantly, please don't worry about your payment as We will make sure it is protected under all circumstances!<br>
